Respond with only the letter (A, B, C, D, or E) corresponding to your answer choice.\\n\\n### Input:\\nContext: Newtonian gravitational theory | Modern priority controversy | Since the time of Newton and Hooke, scholarly discussion has also touched on the question of whether Hooke's 1679 mention of 'compounding the motions' provided Newton with something new and valuable, even though that was not a claim actually voiced by Hooke at the time. As described above, Newton's manuscripts of the 1660s do show him actually combining tangential motion with the effects of radially directed force or endeavour, for example in his derivation of the inverse square relation for the circular case. They also show Newton clearly expressing the concept of linear inertia\\u2014for which he was indebted to Descartes' work, published in 1644 (as Hooke probably was). These matters do not appear to have been learned by Newton from Hooke.\\n\\nNevertheless, a number of authors have had more to say about what Newton gained from Hooke and some aspects remain controversial. The fact that most of Hooke's private papers had been destroyed or have disappeared does not help to establish the truth. Newton's role in relation to the inverse square law was not as it has sometimes been represented. He did not claim to think it up as a bare idea. What Newton did, was to show how the inverse-square law of attraction had many necessary mathematical connections with observable features of the motions of bodies in the solar system; and that they were related in such a way that the observational evidence and the mathematical demonstrations, taken together, gave reason to believe that the inverse square law was not just approximately true but exactly true (to the accuracy achievable in Newton's time and for about two centuries afterwards \\u2013 and with some loose ends of points that could not yet be certainly examined, where the implications of the theory had not yet been adequately identified or calculated).About thirty years after Newton's death in 1727, Alexis Clairaut, a mathematical astronomer eminent in his own right in the field of gravitational studies, wrote after reviewing what Hooke published, that \\\"One must not think that this idea ... of Hooke diminishes Newton's glory\\\"; and that \\\"the example of Hooke\\\" serves \\\"to show what a distance there is between a truth that is glimpsed and a truth that is demonstrated\\\".\\n\\n||\\n\\nPhilosophi\\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica | Newton's early work on motion | In the 1660s Newton studied the motion of colliding bodies and deduced that the centre of mass of two colliding bodies remains in uniform motion. Surviving manuscripts of the 1660s also show Newton's interest in planetary motion and that by 1669 he had shown, for a circular case of planetary motion, that the force he called \\\"endeavour to recede\\\" (now called centrifugal force) had an inverse-square relation with distance from the center. After his 1679\\u20131680 correspondence with Hooke, described below, Newton adopted the language of inward or centripetal force. According to Newton scholar J. Bruce Brackenridge, although much has been made of the change in language and difference of point of view, as between centrifugal or centripetal forces, the actual computations and proofs remained the same either way.\\n\\nThey also involved the combination of tangential and radial displacements, which Newton was making in the 1660s. The difference between the centrifugal and centripetal points of view, though a significant change of perspective, did not change the analysis. Newton also clearly expressed the concept of linear inertia in the 1660s: for this Newton was indebted to Descartes' work published 1644.\\n\\nQuestion: What did Newton's manuscripts of the 1660s show?\\n\\nOptions:\\nA: Newton's manuscripts showed that he learned about the inverse square law from Hooke's private papers.\\n\\nB: Newton's manuscripts showed that he was indebted to Descartes' work, published in 1644, for the concept of linear inertia.\\n\\nC: Newton combined tangential motion with the effects of radially directed force or endeavour and expressed the concept of linear inertia.\\n\\nD: Newton learned about tangential motion and radially directed force or endeavour from Hooke's work.\\n\\nE: Newton's manuscripts did not show any evidence of combining tangential motion with the effects of radially directed force or endeavour.\\n\\n\\nAnswer:\"\n"
